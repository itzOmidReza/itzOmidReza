## About Me
I am a Software Engineering student focused on web development. I enjoy turning ideas into production-ready applications with clean architecture and good UX. I blend frontend polish with robust backend solutions and explore machine learning and AI tools to create smarter products.

- 🔭 Currently building: web applications using **Nuxt**, **TypeScript**, and **NestJS**  
- 🌱 Learning & experimenting with **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and AI tooling  
- 🎨 I design interfaces and prototypes in **Figma**  
- ⚡ I value maintainable code, automated workflows, and user-focused design

---

## Hobbies & Interests
- 🥋 **Judo** — passionate practitioner; I love discipline, training, and the problem-solving aspect of martial arts.  
- 🎮 **Gaming** — enjoy PC games for relaxation and strategic thinking; happy to collaborate on game-related web tools or dashboards.  
- ☕ Combining learning sessions with short training/gaming breaks keeps me creative and focused.
